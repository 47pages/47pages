				h3 Feather Flores (PO '17)
				h4 Managing Editor for Production, Co-Founder
				p
					| Feather is an English major and has written or designed for more than five publications. Most of the

				h3 Mikayla Reine (PO ‘17)
				h4 Senior Literature Editor
				p
					| Mikayla is a ballerina-turned-academic who never mastered the art of sitting still. She spends most
					| of her time scurrying from place to place with a book in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other,

				h4 Junior Literature Editor

					| Harry is a freshman at Pomona College who loves beauty and challenge, especially both in one.

				h3 Ian Dangla (PO ‘17)
				h4 Junior Literature Editor
				p
					| Ian is a totally undecided wishy-washy liberal arts student who recognizes that he knows nothing

				h4 Junior Literature Editor
				p
					| Emma is a freshman at Pomona College, and is a potential English major. She has edited various
					| publications for four years and has been working with creative writing ever since dabbling in
					| heavy-handed meta-fiction. She is thrilled to be a part of this publication and will happily
					| pore over submissions all day long. Emma loves comedies with a dramatic edge, unusually-flavored
					| sodas, and grammar.
